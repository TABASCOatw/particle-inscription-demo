  <h3>
    Particle Smart WaaS Inscription Demo
  </h3>
</div>

‚ö°Ô∏è Demo application showcasing the creation, minting, and transfer of PRC-20 (inscriptions) tokens through Wallet-as-a-Service on Polygon, in which the associated transactions are routed through a smart account and thus made gasless, all powered by the [Particle Auth Core SDK](https://docs.particle.network/developers/auth-service/core/web).

This same methodology was used within Particle Network's "The People's Alliance" campaign (the largest community inscription event in Web3).

Built using **Particle Auth Core**, **TypeScript**, **Particle AA SDK**

## üîë Particle Auth Core
Particle Auth Core, a component of Particle Network's Wallet-as-a-Service, enables seamless onboarding to an application-embedded MPC-TSS/AA wallet facilitated by social login, such as Google, GitHub, email, phone number, etc. - as an alternative to Particle Auth, the Auth Core SDK comes with more control over the modal itself, application-embedded popups rather than redirects, and so on.
